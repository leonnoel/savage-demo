# 21 Savage Fan Site - Server side

This project is modelled off of a sociale media website. Uers can write a message, it will upload to the messages section of the page, and other users can like or dislike each person's message - the number of likes will increase and decrease accordingly. Messages can be deleted by clicking the trashcan.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

This is a simple CRUD app, with my first time using express. It is easier to see what is happening in the server side using CRUD to design the functions here.

## Lessons Learned:

As I continue using Express, Node and MongoDB, things are starting to make more sense. I am wondering what other ways I can update or "put" in the server to make the site more creative.
