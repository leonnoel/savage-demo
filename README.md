<b>Tech Used:</b> EJS, CSS3, JavaScript, Node.js and MongoDB

<b>Lessons Learned</b>: A main part of this project was getting the icons to function correctly. E.g. Getting the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to work and adjust the number based on what was clicked. I was able to figure it out, but seeing overall how that contributed to the page was very cool.
