### Process:

<ol>
  <li>Back end, back end.  I can't wait to leave the back end.</li>
  <li>This one a simple enough; create a thumbs down buttom to go along with the thumbs up.  The only issue is that the button clicks should update the same number.<li>
  <li>Originally, my group (go House Gardner!) figured out how to make two seperate numbers; this was <strong>not</strong> the goal.</li>
  <li>Most of the code was boiler plate, so there was not much to actually write.  It was a matter of finding out how the first existing button works and tweaking that into something subtracts from the thumbs up counter that was already set.<li>
  <li>It turns out, that instead of duplicating the same 'thumbs up' code and changing the values to be 'thumbs down,' we needed to create a function that did everything that the thumbs up button did... except add 'minus one.'</li>
  <li><em>Are you kiddin' me?</em></li>
   <li>All we had to do was create another function that did the same exact thing, but minus one...</li>
  <li>Array.from....</li> 
 <li>But hey, at least it's done.</li> 

<p>Overall, I'm still trying to get used to back end.  It makes sense... in a sense, but also I'm kinda like '???' when things that <em>should</em> work don't.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>It works.  I do not understand it TOO much, but it works.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 2 <em>I have a lot of review to do.</em></li>
</ul>
