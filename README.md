## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

My learning was focused on utilizing the express's get, post, put, delete methods. A simple blog post was the perfect practice for that. I was able to make it where you can create an account. When logged into your account you are able to post messages on a wall where everyone with an account can see it, like it or delete it.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how on a basic level to use express.js. I learned how to set up a get request to get a certain page to render; post on that page; update that post by liking it; then finally deleting that post if need be.
