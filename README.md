## Languages Used

This was created using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MongoDB, and Node.js.

The assignment was to understand the code, use my own MongoDB, and fix the thumbs down button. I used some bootstap on it.

## Lesson Learned

I learned how to use a separate JS file to add event listeners to the button and to send info from the DOM to the server. It was also a good example to see and understand how CRUD is used
